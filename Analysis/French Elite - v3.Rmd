In this homework, we are going to study the "FRENCH FINANCIAL ELITE" dataset downloaded from http://moreno.ss.uci.edu/. 
This dataset is composed of three 28 by 28 matrices on the influence, the belonging of an elite and the friendship of 28 top French leaders in Finance.
We also have information about their background such as religion, education or age...

\section*{Hypothesis}
I want to study the characteristics of powerfull member of an elite. 
At first, I wanted to see the impact of higher education on the influence of leaders in an elite group. However, education level may not be a differentiable factor as all leaders when through inpressive school (in particular in France where people are considered based on the school they went to.
Another factor that is more easy to anticipate is the level of religion defined as the belief in god and the frequency of praying.

We want to test the relation between religion and position of power in an elite group. In particular, we hypothesis that the more powerful a leader is the less he prays and believe in god.

\section*{Explanation}
In France, the concept of "laïcité" (secularism) is particularly important in higher education school and in high business circle and elite people come from these school. Hence, even if they may come from religious family, they will probably get away from religion after and during their higher education. Furthermore, the financial elite is busy and we could think that don't have to much time to pray and think about religion and god. Finally, financial leaders tends to prove their skills by their understanding of financial markets and business and not by showing their faith in god.

So I would think that French financial leaders are less linked to religion when they are more influencial.

Let's use the dataset to analyze that

\section*{Variables}

For this study, 3 types of variables have been selected.
 1."birthdate"      
 2."sciencepoly", "polytech", "university", "normal.sch", "ena"                    
 3. "religion" 
 
Birthdate is an independent variable, it gives an idea of which elite member is part of which generation
Education variables are binary coded (true or false)
Religion is a class variable coded from 2 to 4 (2 is low religion level and 4 is high religion level)

To this attribute, we add the ego network measure: transity and network size for elite and influence

Influence network: "WHO INFLUENCES YOU"
```{r}
influenceg=graph.adjacency(influence,mode="directed",weighted=NULL)

### calculate ego network influence size ###
attributes$influence.degree <- degree(influenceg)
ggplot(attributes, aes(x= religion, y =influence.degree )) +
    geom_point(shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
    geom_smooth()    

### calculate transitivity of elite ego network ###
attributes$Influence.transitivity =transitivity(influenceg, type="local")  
attributes$Influence.transitivity[attributes$Influence.transitivity == "NA"] <- mean(attributes$Influence.transitivity)

ggplot(attributes, aes(x= religion, y =Influence.transitivity )) +
    geom_point(shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
    geom_smooth()    

```

Elite network: "WHO IS IN THE ELITE"
```{r}
eliteg=graph.adjacency(elite,mode="undirected",weighted=NULL)
### calculate ego network elite size ###
attributes$elite.degree <- degree(eliteg)
ggplot(attributes, aes(x= religion, y =elite.degree )) +
    geom_point(shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
    geom_smooth()    

### calculate transitivity of elite ego network ###
attributes$elite.transitivity =transitivity(eliteg, type="local")  
attributes$elite.transitivity[attributes$elite.transitivity == "NaN"] <- mean(attributes$elite.transitivity)

ggplot(attributes, aes(x= religion, y =elite.transitivity )) +
    geom_point(shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
    geom_smooth()    




```


\section*{Initial results}

If we look at the elite network and the influence network, we see in both case a clear decreasing factor between religion and the place in the elite.
Elite member tend to have a more influential place when they spend less time to pray.
If we just plot the average amount of excitement people claim as a function
of the average educational attainment of their social circle, we see that as
one’s social circle is more educated, the higher excitement ego’s report.

However, it's interesting to see that transitivity is positively correlated with religion in this dataset. Religious people may be less influential but more connected to their religious peers.


We will now use regression model to further study these ideas.

\section*{Model 1}
We first start by studying the impact on influence:
```{r}
summary(lm(influence.degree~ religion, attributes))
summary(lm(Influence.transitivity~ religion, attributes))
```

The regression on influence degree validates the idea of negative correlation between religion and influence with a p-value lower than 5% and a beta estimate of approximately -3.
Clearly we note that more religion means less influence in our dataset.

However, we can not confirm our hypothesis on religion and the transitivity of influence because the p-value is too high aroung 30%.


\section*{Model 2}
To be sure of our first idea on education we will the education variables in our model:
```{r}
summary(lm(influence.degree ~ ena + sciencepoly + polytech + university + normal.sch, attributes))
summary(lm(Influence.transitivity~ ena + sciencepoly + polytech + university + normal.sch, attributes))
```

As expected, we note that we cannot infer any correlation between education and influence because p-values are too high. The dataset is too small to detects the impact of these binary variables on the influence levels.

\section*{Model 3}
To confirm our analysis, we will reproduce our linear regression on the elite data.
This will help us determine if being part of the elite is linked to being influential.

```{r}
summary(lm(elite.degree~ religion, attributes))
summary(lm(elite.transitivity~ religion, attributes))
summary(lm(elite.degree ~ ena + sciencepoly + polytech + university + normal.sch, attributes))
summary(lm(elite.transitivity~ ena + sciencepoly + polytech + university + normal.sch, attributes))
```

The results are similar than with the influence network. We have relatively similar level of p-value and the only thing that we can infer is that religion is negatively correlated with being part of the elite.

\section*{Conclusion}
I have given my conclusions throughout, but in summary, the answer
appears to be “yes, one’s social circle’s average education does influence
how exciting life seems.” The exact nature of the causality here is yet to be
determined, but we have made it part of the way there.

5. Consider alternate specifications of your variables (i.e., recodings of various
kinds). Consider interactions among your variables.
Remember that we wondered if a highly educated social circle contributes to
a person’s excitement with life above and beyond simple the correlation
between one’s own education and one’s excitement with life. Model 2 tests
that. Results indicate that the positive role for educated alters on one’s sense
of excitement largely persists and remains highly statistically significant
(going from 0.09 in Model 1 to 0.067 in Model 2), even after including one’s
own education level, net of ego network size.

Model 3 controls for more factors that we think might affect excitement with
life and might be correlated with average education of social circle-- things
like age (measured from 18 years of age to 89 years and older); religious
service attendance (an 8-category variable, ranging from never to everyday);
what sort of marital arrangement people have (i.e., married, never married,
divorced, separated or widowed); race (either white, black or other); number
of children (top-coded to 8 or more); and being a woman, vs. a man. Those
controls change the results virtually nothing at all-- the coefficient on
average education of alters goes from 0.066 to 0.07.

Model 4 considers if there is an interaction between one’s own education
level and the education level of ego’s social circle. The theory here being
that the interaction should be positive, indicating that ego can get even more
excitement out of life if ego is highly educated and the alters are too, since it
makes the opportunities even bigger (since maybe money is no object) or
that interactions are even funnier (because everyone is getting everyone
else’s jokes). There might be just some synergy among all of the people that
just generates even more excitement. The results do show a positive
coefficient on the interaction (0.0004), as predicted, but it is not statistically
significant. That means that ego’s education and the social circle’s
educations are important, but they do not reinforce or magnify each other.
They just work additively.

Model 5 considers if the diversity of educations of one’s social circle affects
how much excitement one derives from life. The effect of diversity could
work in opposite ways. On the one hand, it could make everything in life
even more exciting, since “variety is the spice of life.” We would expect a
positive coefficient then. On the other hand, increased educational diversity
of the social circle could make it harder to manage relationships and make
life more arduous, which might make it less exciting.
I constructed the standard deviation of the network analogously to how I did
the mean, thusly:
> educs = c("educ1", "educ2", "educ3", "educ4", "educ5")
> sub <� gss[, educs]
> sub2=transform(sub, SD=apply(sub,1, sd, na.rm = TRUE))
> colnames(sub2)[6] <� "sdeduc"
> gss <� data.frame(gss, sub2[,"sdeduc"])
> colnames(gss)
> colnames(gss)[2112] <� "sdeduc”
Results are in Model 5. They indicate a negative but statistically insignificant
effect on one’s excitement with life. It does not look like diversity of one’s
social circle’s educations matters here.
